Library Scanning:
  Traverse a directory tree; for each file:
    If the file is known:
      Test that the file hasn't been updated via mtime
    Otherwise (file is unknown)
      Add the file to couch after hashing/tagging

  Each file should look like this in couch:

  {
    id: "/Users/dave/.rockon/music/Vermin/Vermin - Chemical.mp3",
    mtime: "2010-07-13T12:26:19Z",
    metadata: {
      title: "Chemical",
      artist: "Vermin"
    }
    digest: "deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef"
  }
